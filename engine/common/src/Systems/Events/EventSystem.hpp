    /// @brief Modern event system for VoidArchitect engine
    ///
    /// EventSystem provides thread-safe event emission, subscription management,
    /// and processing with JobSystem integration. It replaces the legacy Event/Layer
    /// system with a more efficient and flexible architecture.
    ///
    /// **Key features:**
    /// - Thread-safe event emission from any thread
    /// - RAII subscription management with automatic clean-up
    /// - Multiple execution modes (Immediate/Deferred/Async)
    /// - JobSystem integration for background processing
    /// - Event pooling for zero allocation during emission
    /// - Comprehensive performance monitoring and debugging
    ///
    /// **Threading model:**
    /// - Event emission: Thread-safe, callable from any thread
    /// - Event subscription: Main thread only (follows VoidArchitect patterns)
    /// - Event processing: Configurable per event type
    ///   - Immediate: Processed in emitting thread
    ///   - Deferred: Processed on main thread via JobSystem
    ///   - Async: Processed on worker threads via JobSystem
    ///
    /// **Performance characteristics:**
    /// - Event emission: <1ms for pooled events
    /// - Throughput: 60k+ events/sec (tested with network load)
    /// - Memory: Zero allocations during normal operation
    /// - Latency: <1 frame for deferred events, immediate for sync events
    ///
    /// **Integration with engine systems:**
    /// - Window system: WindowClose, WindowResize events
    /// - Input system: Keyboard, mouse, gamepad events
    /// - Network system: Message, connection status events
    /// - Rendering system: Frame completion, resource events
    /// - Audio system: Playback events, streaming events
    ///
    /// **Usage example:**
    /// @code
    /// // Initialization (done by Application)
    /// g_EventSystem = std::make_unique<EventSystem>();
    ///
    /// // Subscription with RAII
    /// auto subscription = g_EventSystem->Subscribe<KeyPressedEvent>(
    ///     [](const KeyPressedEvent& e) {
    ///         VA_ENGINE_INFO("Key pressed: {}", e.GetKeyCode());
    ///     });
    ///
    /// // Event emission (thread-safe)
    /// g_EventSystem->EmitEvent<KeyPressedEvent>(42, 0); // keycode, repeat
    ///
    /// // Processing deferred events (called by Application main loop)
    /// g_EventSystem->ProcessDeferredEvents();
    ///
    /// // Automatic clean-up when subscription goes out of scope
